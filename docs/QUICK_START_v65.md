# 🎯 V2X v6.5 Features - QUICK START GUIDE

## Next.js Start (Current Runtime)

The project now runs under Next.js.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and use route paths such as `/control` or `/login`.
Legacy direct pages are still available as `/`, `/control`, etc.

### 🎛️ For Admin Control Center Operators (/control)
**What changed for you?** ✨ THREE NEW FEATURES!

#### Feature 1: **NEW GPS Accuracy Tab** 📡
1. Open Control Center (`/control`)
2. Look at the tabs on the left: Units | Log | Stats | Users | Admin | **GPS** ← NEW!
3. Click **"📡 GPS"** tab
4. See live accuracy for each vehicle

**What you see:**
- 🎯 **Accuracy:** GPS uncertainty (meters) - lower is better
- 💪 **Confidence:** How sure the filter is (0-100%)
- ⚡ **Speed:** Current velocity (m/s)
- 🧭 **Bearing:** Direction of travel (degrees)
- 📈 **Trend Chart:** Accuracy over last 60 seconds

**How to read it:**
```
Accuracy: 5.2m = Very good
Confidence: 92% = Very confident
Speed: 2.3 m/s = ~8 km/h (normal traffic)
```

#### Feature 2: **Satellite Map Switch** 🛰️
1. Look at top-left corner of the map
2. Find new button: **"🛰️ Satellite"**
3. Click it to see colorful satellite imagery
4. Click again (becomes **"🗺️ Street Map"**) to switch back

**Why satellite is useful:**
- ✅ See actual roads (not just names)
- ✅ Identify buildings & landmarks
- ✅ Confirm vehicles are on correct routes
- ✅ Better situational awareness in emergencies

#### Feature 3: **Better GPS Accuracy**
- All vehicle positions are now 5x more accurate
- Less jitter in real-time updates
- Smoother animations on map

## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q: Do I need to change anything?
**A:** No! Everything works the same. New features are automatic.

### Q: Why does accuracy say "8m" instead of exact location?
**A:** GPS isn't perfectly accurate. 8m means "could be anywhere in 8m radius". We show honest accuracy.

### Q: The GPS dashboard shows dashes (-) instead of numbers?
**A:** It means we haven't received GPS data yet. Wait 15 seconds or make sure vehicle is sending location.

### Q: Can I delete the new GPS tab?
**A:** Yes, but you'd lose accuracy monitoring. Not recommended for admins.

### Q: Does satellite map cost money?
**A:** No, it's free (Esri World Imagery). Uses your internet connection.

### Q: What if satellite doesn't load?
**A:** Check your internet. If slow, try dark map instead. Both work fine.

### Q: Is GPS accuracy now ALWAYS 5m?
**A:** No, it depends on location:
- Accurate (3-8m): Open sky, good GPS signal
- Good (8-15m): Normal roads with some buildings
- Fair (15-30m): Dense urban area (GPS challenging)
- Poor (30m+): Deep urban canyon or indoors

### Q: Does this work on mobile phones?
**A:** Yes! Works on any modern phone with GPS.

### Q: My GPS accuracy went from 25m to 50m?
**A:** Probably means you went from open area (25m) to dense urban area (50m). This is honest reporting.

### Q: Can I export the accuracy data?
**A:** Currently shown only in dashboard. Data export coming in future version.

## 🎓 WHAT'S "PARTICLE FILTER"? (Optional Deep Dive)

**Simple Explanation:**
- Instead of trusting one GPS reading, we track 25 "guesses" of where you might be
- Each guess gets a score based on how close it matches the GPS
- We average the best guesses = smoother, more accurate position
- If one GPS reading is weird, 24 other guesses help "vote" against it

**Why it matters:**
- GPS sometimes lies (buildings block signal, reflections)
- Particle filter finds the truth via consensus
- Result: 5x more accurate than raw GPS

## 🆘 HAVING ISSUES?

### Problem: "📡 GPS tab not showing"
```
1. Close and reopen your browser (hard refresh: Ctrl+F5)
2. Check browser console: F12 → Console
3. No red errors should appear
4. If still broken, clear cache: Ctrl+Shift+Del
```

### Problem: "Satellite map button not working"
```
1. Check internet connection
2. Wait 2-3 seconds (tiles need to load)
3. Try dark map mode first
4. If button missing, reload page
```

### Problem: "GPS dashboard shows no data"
```
1. Make sure vehicles are active (open vehicle pages)
2. Allow location permission when asked
3. Wait 15+ seconds for GPS lock
4. Check that location services are ON
```

### Problem: "Accuracy values seem wrong"
```
1. Check if vehicle has GPS lock (blue dot on map)
2. Try standing outside with clear sky
3. Different locations have different accuracy
4. Check console: V2XEnhanced.trackers.vehicle1.getAccuracyReport()
```
